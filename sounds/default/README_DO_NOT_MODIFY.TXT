WARNING: DO NOT CHANGE THESE SOUND FILES

These sound files are required by the BeepBeep plugin to function correctly.
Modifying or renaming them may break the plugin.

To override a sound:
- Place a new file outside this folder.
- Use the SAME BASE NAME as the original sound (extension does not matter).
- The plugin will automatically use your custom file instead of the default.

Default sounds include:
neutral, friend, foe

DO NOT DELETE OR RENAME FILES IN THIS FOLDER.
